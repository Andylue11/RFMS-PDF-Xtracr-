## Known Issues to Address

1. **Customer Name Extraction**: Some PDFs show "Unit" instead of actual customer name
2. **Campbell Construction**: Needs more work on extraction patterns
3. **Address Parsing**: Some addresses include extra information that should be filtered

## Recommendations

1. Continue refining extraction patterns based on more PDF samples
2. Add more builder templates as new builders are onboarded
3. Consider adding manual override options for critical fields
4. Implement data validation to catch obvious extraction errors
