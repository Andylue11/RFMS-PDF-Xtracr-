You're right to check! Actually, I did add configurations for all 6 builders in the PDF extractor. Let me show you the current configuration and commit these changes to ensure they're saved:

Read file: utils/pdf_extractor.py
Great! I can confirm that I have indeed added configurations for all 6 builders in the PDF extractor:

1. **Ambrose Construct Group** - Default template (PO format: 20XXXXXX-XX)
2. **Profile Build Group** - (PO format: PBG-XXXXX-XXXXX) 
3. **Campbell Construction** - (PO format: CCCXXXXX-XXXXX)
4. **Rizon Group** - (PO format: PXXXXXX)
5. **Australian Restoration Company** - (PO format: POXXXXX-XXXX-XXX)
6. **Townsend Building Services** - (PO format: TBS-XXXXX or work order numbers)

Plus a **generic template** as a fallback for any PDFs that don't match the specific patterns.

Let me commit these changes to ensure they're saved:

```bash
git status
```

```bash
git commit -m "Final update to PDF extractor with all 6 builder templates configured"
```

```bash
git push origin feature/new-fork
```
Let me now update the PDF_TEMPLATE_GUIDE.md to reflect all 6 builders:


Now let's commit this documentation update:

```bash
git add PDF_TEMPLATE_GUIDE.md
```

```bash
git commit -m "Update PDF_TEMPLATE_GUIDE.md with complete details for all 6 builder templates"
```

```bash
git push origin feature/new-fork
```
Perfect! I've confirmed and updated all the necessary files. The PDF extractor now supports all 6 builders:

## âœ… Configured Builder Templates:

1. **Ambrose Construct Group** (20XXXXXX-XX format)
2. **Profile Build Group** (PBG-XXXXX-XXXXX format) 
3. **Campbell Construction** (CCCXXXXX-XXXXX format)
4. **Rizon Group** (PXXXXXX format)
5. **Australian Restoration Company** (POXXXXX-XXXX-XXX format)
6. **Townsend Building Services** (TBS-XXXXX format)

## Key Features:

- **Automatic Template Detection**: The system analyzes the PDF content and automatically selects the appropriate template based on PO number patterns, company names, and document structure
- **Flexible Field Mapping**: Different terminology (Client/Customer, Scope of Works/Description of Works, etc.) is automatically mapped to standard fields
- **Fallback Support**: If specific patterns don't match, the system uses generic patterns to extract data
- **Test PDFs Available**: You have 2 test PDFs per builder in the "testing pdfs" folder for validation

The enhanced PDF extractor is now ready to handle PDFs from all 6 builders, automatically detecting the format and extracting the relevant data!
